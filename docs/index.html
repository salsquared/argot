            <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
            <p>This privacy policy applies to the Argot app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices

            <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The
                Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through
                the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
                their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to
                provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their
                permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information
                to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider
                (salsalcedo4321@gmail.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at

            <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However,
                since the Application does not collect any information, there is no risk of your data being accessed by
                unauthorized individuals.</p>
            <br><strong>Changes</strong>
